The Census data is then extracted to include adults only and income is masked to either <= 50K or > 50K. "

    "\n",
    "The question posed for this assignment is: \n",
    "Are `income` of <= 50K and > 50K, `race` and `sex` associated with the level of education of all American individuals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the `education-num` is a useful numeric indicator of education level, we could perform an additive multiple linear regression with the categorical/logical variables `income`, `sex`, and `race` and determine if the mean level of education are different. Then, we can determine if the mean level of education is statistically significant than the `income`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could create a response variable: $Y$ representing the mean education-num.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we could create variables, $X_{female}$, $X_{>50K}$, and $X_{race}$ for 4 races other than the reference. We setting one value as a reference, so all $X$ is either 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an inferential question, such that the hypothesis tests below are describe as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0: \\beta_i = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_A: \\beta_i \\neq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\beta$ of all variables $X$ and $\\beta_0$ representing the intercept or the mean education-num of of the reference level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with the census, which is a big sample and similar to the population, we should take random samples from it. This is to preserve computational resources because the dataset contains high volume. As well, we can calculate use statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to make inferences of the population."
